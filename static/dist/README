Vanadium is JavaScript validation toolkit that makes client-side validation easy.
Here's a rundown of the functionality:

* Validation rules are applied to HTML elements by adding special markup classes. E.g. adding ':required' to element's classes
makes the element being validated against provided value
* Instead of markup, one can use external definition provided as json structure.
* It is Ajax enabled in that sense one can declare particular field being validated by the result of the server response.
E.g. adding ':ajax;/path_on_server/user_exists.json' to element's classes will cause any change to value of that element being
sent to server as request. The response is expected to be json structure in the form of:
 {success: (true/false), [message: (MESSAGE_TEXT)], [advice_id: (ID_OF_THE_HTML_ELEMENT_USED_FOR_INJECTING_THE_MESSAGE)]}


To have a html form with 4 fields: username, email, password and repeated password.
Where username is required and has to be at least 5 characters long and unique in the system, email is valid email adders
password is required and has to be at least 6 character long, repeated password has to be the same as password, then one use
the following HTML:


<input id="name" class=":required :min_length;5 :ajax;http://host.com/user_exists.json" type="text">
<input id="email" class=":required  :email" type="text">
<input id="pass" class=":required :min_length;6" type="password">
<input id="repeat_pass" class=":same_as;pass" type="password">

* The the default (:;) markup prefix and separator can be reconfigured.

* :ajax;http://host.com/user_exists.json in the example is server-side validation which Vanadium uses for checking if given username
is already taken.
